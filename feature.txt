This is a feature branch.
This lab has helped me understand how git and github are useful for software engineers and anyone who in general working on projects
to help track changes in my code, allowing you to revert to previous versions if something goes wrong. It acts as a backup system, preventing data loss. I've learnt how to use git and the commands to push and pull. Git isn’t just a skill—it’s a necessity in modern software development. Mastering it will boost your efficiency, collaboration, and employability.
